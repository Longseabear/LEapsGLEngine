# LEaps ECS Pattern

## Overview

### What is ECS?

Entity-Component-System (ECS) is a design pattern widely used in software development, especially in game development. It divides the application into three key components:

1. **Entities:** Unique identifiers representing basic objects in the system.

2. **Components:** Data containers holding specific attributes or behaviors, describing properties of an entity.

3. **System:** Manages logic and behavior of entities based on their components, processing entities with specific combinations.

## LEaps ECS Pattern

LEaps (Lightweight ECS for Advanced Performance and Scalability) is an ECS pattern designed for efficiency and scalability, particularly suitable for real-time systems and game engines. 

### Key Features

1. **Efficiency:** High performance achieved by minimizing memory overhead and maximizing cache coherence.

2. **Scalability:** Designed to scale well with a large number of entities and components, allowing efficient queries.

3. **Flexibility:** Easily add, remove, and modify components without significant impact on performance.

## Sparse Table Architecture

### What is Sparse Table Architecture?

In LEaps, the ECS pattern is implemented using a sparse table architecture to optimize memory usage and improve cache locality.

### How Sparse Table Architecture Works

1. **Sparse Data Storage:** Tables only store components for entities possessing those specific components, reducing memory consumption.

2. **Cache Coherence:** Enhances cache coherence by storing related data close in memory, improving performance.

3. **Dynamic Composition:** Allows dynamic composition of entities and components without affecting memory layout.

## Getting Started

To integrate LEaps ECS into your project:

1. Clone the LEaps ECS repository.

2. Include necessary headers and source files in your project.

3. Define entities, components, and systems following the ECS pattern.

4. Leverage the sparse table architecture for efficient memory usage and improved performance.

Refer to documentation and examples for detailed instructions on using LEaps ECS in your application.

## Conclusion

LEaps ECS Pattern provides a lightweight, efficient, and scalable solution for systems requiring high performance. By embracing the sparse table architecture, developers can create fast, flexible, and maintainable applications.
